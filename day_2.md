## Key Concepts Covered:
1. Anaconda Installation and Environment setup.
2. Jupyter Notebook: Features and basic usage.
3. VS Code: Installing and configuring for Python development.
4. Introduction to commonly used libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.
5. Running simple Python commands and notebooks.
