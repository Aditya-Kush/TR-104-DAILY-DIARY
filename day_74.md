# VERSION CONTROL AND PUSHING PROJECTS USING GIT

Today, I focused on understanding how version control works with Git and how to push a local project to a remote repository like GitHub. This process helps in safely managing code changes and collaborating with others by syncing your local code with a central online repository.

## What is Version Control?

- Version Control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later.
- It allows developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and work concurrently without conflicts.
- Git is one of the most popular distributed version control systems used widely in software and data science projects.

## Steps to Push a Local Project to GitHub

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

In your project folder, initialize Git to start tracking changes:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - added project files"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
```
