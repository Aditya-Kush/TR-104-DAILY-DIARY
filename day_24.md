# Descriptive Statistics: Mean, Median, and Mode 
---

## Introduction  
Mean, median, and mode are fundamental measures of central tendency that summarize a dataset by identifying a central point.

---

## Mean  
- The arithmetic average of a set of values.  
- Calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.  
- Sensitive to outliers.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
\]

---

## Median  
- The middle value when data is ordered.  
- Divides the dataset into two equal halves.  
- Robust to outliers.

**Calculation Steps:**  
1. Sort the data.  
2. If odd number of observations, median is the middle value.  
3. If even number, median is the average of the two middle values.

---

## Mode  
- The most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset.  
- Can be no mode, one mode (unimodal), or multiple modes (multimodal).

---

## Example  
Consider the dataset of daily sales (units):  
`12, 15, 14, 10, 18, 20, 16`

- **Mean:**  
  \[
  \frac{12 + 15 + 14 + 10 + 18 + 20 + 16}{7} = \frac{105}{7} = 15
  \]

- **Median:**  
  Sorted data: `10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20`  
  Middle value (4th) = 15

- **Mode:**  
  No repeated values, so no mode.

## Summary  
| Measure | Value | Notes                  |
|---------|-------|------------------------|
| Mean    | 15    | Average value          |
| Median  | 15    | Middle value           |
| Mode    | None  | No repeating value     |

Understanding these measures helps summarize data quickly and provides insight into data distribution before deeper analysis.
