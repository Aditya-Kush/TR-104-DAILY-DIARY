# Descriptive Statistics in Data Science

## Overview
Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a data set. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, giving insight into the distribution, central tendency, and variability of the data.

## Day 1: 27 February 2025  
### Introduction to Descriptive Statistics  
- **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode  
- **Measures of Dispersion:** Range, Variance, Standard Deviation  
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, Boxplots

### Example  
Consider the following data points representing daily sales (in units):  
`12, 15, 14, 10, 18, 20, 16`

- Mean = (12 + 15 + 14 + 10 + 18 + 20 + 16) / 7 = 15  
- Median = 15 (middle value when data sorted)  
- Mode = No mode (all values unique)  
- Range = 20 - 10 = 10  
- Variance and Standard Deviation can be calculated to understand spread.

### Exploring Data Distribution  
- **Skewness:** Measure of asymmetry of the data distribution.  
- **Kurtosis:** Measure of the “tailedness” of the distribution.

### Example  
Using the sales data from Day 1, plot a histogram to visualize distribution.  
Interpret if the data is symmetric or skewed.

### Summary and Application in Data Science  
- Descriptive statistics help understand the nature of data before modeling.  
- They are crucial for data cleaning, anomaly detection, and feature engineering.  
- Real-world applications include customer segmentation, quality control, and risk assessment.

### Final Notes  
Always complement descriptive statistics with data visualization for better insights.
