# Basic Excel Formulas and Functions  

Today, I learned how to use basic Excel formulas and functions to perform calculations and automate data processing.

---

## Key Concepts Covered:
1. Writing simple formulas: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
2. Using cell references in formulas.
3. Common functions: SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX.
4. AutoFill feature for copying formulas.
5. Understanding relative and absolute cell references.

## Formulas in Excel  
- Formulas start with an equals sign (=).
- You can perform arithmetic operations using cell references (e.g., =A1+B1).
- Formulas update automatically when referenced cells change.

---

## Common Functions  
- `SUM(range)`: Adds all numbers in a range.
- `AVERAGE(range)`: Calculates the average of numbers.
- `MIN(range)`: Finds the smallest number.
- `MAX(range)`: Finds the largest number.

## Example:  

| A     | B     | C               |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 10    | 20    | =A1+B1 (30)     |
| 5     | 15    | =SUM(A1:A2) (15)|
| 8     | 12    | =AVERAGE(B1:B3) |

## Today's Learning Summary:  
I practiced creating formulas and using basic functions which will help me perform quick calculations and analyze data more efficiently in Excel.
