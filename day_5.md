# Python Basics: Variables, Data Types, and Operators  

Today, I started learning the core basics of Python programming including variables, data types, and operators. This is fundamental for writing any kind of program and will be essential for data manipulation and analysis.

---

## Key Concepts Covered:
1. Variables and assignment.
2. Basic data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
3. Type conversion and casting.
4. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **).
5. Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
6. Logical operators (and, or, not).

## Variables and Data Types  
- Variables are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated.
- Python data types include int, float, str, and bool.
- Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare the variable type explicitly.

---

## Operators in Python  
- Arithmetic operators allow basic math calculations.
- Comparison operators compare values and return boolean results.
- Logical operators help combine multiple conditions in control flow.

## Simple Python Examples  

```python
# Variable assignment
x = 10
y = 5.5
name = "Data Science"

# Arithmetic operations
sum = x + y
power = x ** 2

# Comparison
is_greater = x > y

print(sum, power, is_greater)
